    <header>Introduction</header>
    <p>I've started sewing only a couple of years ago and it all started because we had a wedding to attend that summer and I was desperately looking for a dress to wear and couldn't find anything to my taste. My partner suggested that I make my own and I laughed at the idea because time was limited and I didn't know how to sew a button.</p>
    <p>I eventually found a dress that I liked but still kept in the corner of my head the comment that he made. So I gave it a go. Bought a cheap but good functionning sewing machine, a couple of videos on youtube and I had already made my first napkins! I have never looked back since and here's why...</p>

    <header>The impact of fashion on the environment</header>
    <p>As the years go by and social media is more and more part of our lifes, we become accustomed to buying things that never last for very long. Clothes don't miss out! We see them on someone we follow, we are bombarded by advertisement that tell us that we shouldn't be content with what we already have so we end up buying and buying to fill in an empty space and we never wear them because they didn' make us happier. What people don't realise is that the fashion industry is the second largest polluter in the world, just after the oil industry.</p>
    <p>How?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Water pollution.</li>
      <li>Water consumption.</li>
      <li>Microfibers in our oceans.</li>
      <li>Wastes accumulation.</li>
      <li>Chemicals Addiction.</li>
      <li>Greenhouse gases emissions.</li>
      <li>Soils degradation and desertification.</li>
      <li>Rainforest destruction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What can we do about it?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We need to buy clothes made in countries with stricter environmental regulations for factories such as the EU</li>
      <li>We need to choose organic fibers and natural fibers that do not require chemicals to be produced.</li>
      <li>We need to choose fibers with low water consumption such as linen, recycled fibers.</li>
      <li> We need to mend our old clothes instead of buying new ones.</li>
      <li>We need to make our own clothes with natural fibers to increase the chances of wearing what we make instead of throwing what we buy.</li>
    </ul>
